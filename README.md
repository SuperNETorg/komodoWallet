# [Komodo](https://komodoplatform.com/) Desktop GUI Wallet
[disclaimer](#disclaimer)

## Graphical user interface wrapper for the [Komodo](https://komodoplatform.com/)[disclaimer](#disclaimer) command line tools

This program provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Komodo client tools that acts as a wrapper and
presents the information in a user-friendly manner.

#### New/Experimental: [Komodo Desktop GUI Wallet for Windows](https://github.com/ca333/komodoGUI/blob/master/docs/Readme-Windows.md) is IN WORK
#### Experimental: [Komodo Desktop GUI Wallet for MAC OS X](https://github.com/ca333/komodoGUI/releases/tag/v0.7.7-osx) is available and tested

## Building, installing and running the Wallet GUI


**For security reasons it is recommended to always build the GUI wallet program from GitHub**
**[source](https://github.com/ca333/komodoGUI/archive/master.zip).**
The details of how to build it are described below (easy to follow).
Users who insist on downloading a binary release may instead
use [Komodo Desktop GUI Wallet - binary release v0.7.7-beta](https://github.com/ca333/komodoGUI/releases/tag/v0.7.7-osx)


1. Operating system and tools

   As of April 2017 the base software (Komodo v1.0.8) is mostly tested on Linux, Windows (experimental) and Mac OS X (experimental) (with same limitation as [ZCash](https://z.cash/)).  
   The Linux tools you need to build and run the Wallet GUI are Git, Java (JDK7 or later) and
   Ant. If using Ubuntu Linux, they may be installed via command:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/build-dir$ sudo apt-get install git default-jdk ant
   ```
   For RedHat/CentOS/Fedora-type Linux systems the command is (like):
   ```
   user@centos:~/build-dir$ sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk git ant
   ```
   The name of the JDK package (`java-1.8.0-openjdk`) may vary depending on the Linux system, so you need to
   check it, if name `java-1.8.0-openjdk` is not accepted.
   If you have some other Linux distribution, please check your relevant documentation on installing Git,
   JDK and Ant. The commands `git`, `java`, `javac` and `ant` need to be startable from command line
   before proceeding with build.

2. Building from source code

   As a start you need to clone the komodo-swing-wallet-ui Git repository:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/build-dir$ git clone https://github.com/ca333/komodo-swing-wallet-ui.git
   ```
   Change the current directory:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/build-dir$ cd komodo-swing-wallet-ui/
   ```
   Issue the build command:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/build-dir/komodo-swing-wallet-ui$ ant -buildfile ./src/build/build.xml
   ```
   This takes a few seconds and when it finishes, it builds a JAR file `./build/jars/KomodoSwingWalletUI.jar`.
   You need to make this file executable:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/build-dir/komodo-swing-wallet-ui$ chmod u+x ./build/jars/KomodoSwingWalletUI.jar
   ```
   At this point the build process is finished the built GUI wallet program is the JAR
   file `./build/jars/KomodoSwingWalletUI.jar`

3. Installing the built Komodo GUI wallet

  3.1. If you have built Komodo from source code:

   Assuming you have already built from source code [Komodo](https://github.com/jl777/komodo) in directory `/home/user/komodo/src` (for
   example - this is the typical build dir. for Komodo v1.0.5) which contains the command line tools `komodo-cli`
   and `komodod` you need to take the created file `./build/jars/KomodoSwingWalletUI.jar` and copy it
   to diretcory `/home/user/komodo/src` (the same dir. that contains `komodo-cli` and `komodod`). Example copy command:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/build-dir/komodo-swing-wallet-ui$ cp ./build/jars/KomodoSwingWalletUI.jar /home/user/komodo/src    
   ```

  3.2. If you have installed the Komodo [binary packages](https://github.com/ca333/komodo/)

   The command line tools `komodo-cli` and `komodod` are placed by the package installer in:
   ```
   /usr/bin/komodo-cli
   /usr/bin/komodod
   ```
   The Komodo GUI wallet knows how to find them there. You may place the file  `./build/jars/KomodoSwingWalletUI.jar`
   anywhere in your `/home` directory that you find convenient and start it from there.

4. Running the installed Komodo GUI wallet

   Before running the GUI you need to start komodod (e.g. `komodod --daemon`). The wallet GUI is a Java program packaged
   as an executable JAR file. It may be run from command line or started from another GUI tool (e.g. file manager).
   Assuming you have already installed [Komodo](https://github.com/jl777/komodo) and the GUI Wallet `KomodoSwingWalletUI.jar` in
   directory `/home/user/komodo/src` one way to run it from command line is:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/build-dir/komodo-swing-wallet-ui$ java -jar /home/user/komodo/src/KomodoSwingWalletUI.jar
   ```
   If you are using Ubuntu (or similar ;) Linux you may instead just use the file manager and
   right-click on the `KomodoSwingWalletUI.jar` file and choose the option "Open with OpenJDK 8 Runtime".
   This will start the Komodo GUI wallet.

### Known issues and limitations

1. Limitation: Wallet encryption has been temporarily disabled in ZCash due to stability problems. A corresponding issue
[#1552](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1552) has been opened by the ZCash developers. Correspondingly
wallet encryption has been temporarily disabled in the ZCash Desktop GUI Wallet.
1. Issue: the GUI wallet does not work correctly if zcashd is started with a custom data directory, like:
`zcashd -datadir=/home/data/whatever` This will be fixed in later versions.
1. Issue: GUI data tables (transactions/addresses etc.) allow copying of data via double click but also allow editing.
The latter needs to be disabled.
1. Limitation: The list of transactions does not show all outgoing ones (specifically outgoing Z address
transactions). A corresponding issue [#1438](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1438) has been opened
for the ZCash developers.
1. Limitation: The CPU percentage shown to be taken by zcashd on Linux is the average for the entire lifetime
of the process. This is not very useful. This will be improved in future versions.
